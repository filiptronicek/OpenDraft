"""Quota enforcement — default free-plan file limit.

This module registers a default gate hook that blocks file creation past
FREE_PLAN_FILE_LIMIT (5 by default). Commercial plugins (OpenDraft-Pro)
replace/extend this behavior to enforce paid-tier limits by registering
their own gate hook.

The hook receives `user` (AuthUser) as a keyword argument. It counts the
total number of scripts currently owned by that user across all projects
and raises HTTP 402 Payment Required when the limit would be exceeded.
